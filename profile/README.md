## Auto Machine Learning Model Trainer

The goal of this project was to create a low code solution for non-programmers or people with little knowledge of machine learning. 
Non-programmers will be able to train basic models and receive the parameters used to train the model as well as statistics on its performance. 
This gives the user a starting point for development.

This project was undertake at the AI Encode Club Hackathon 2024.

Through using Inernet Computer, the solution is decentralised and scaleable.

It allows users with little knowledge of machine learning to easily create a starting solution and adjust basic parameters.
